To use Python in ChatGPT, you need to be logged into your account. If you'd prefer not to log in, no worries! Here's the code you can run locally to process the directory structure:
python# Directory structure from the README file
directory_structure = """
nhs-uk-jobs-scraper/
├── src/
│ ├── runner.py
│ ├── extractors/
│ │ ├── job_parser.py
│ │ └── utils.py
│ ├── outputs/
│ │ └── exporters.py
│ └── config/
│ └── settings.example.json
├── data/
│ ├── inputs.sample.txt
│ └── sample.json
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
"""

# Clean and format the directory structure
directory_structure = directory_structure.strip().split('\n')

# Print the directory structure for review
for line in directory_structure:
 print(line)

This will output the directory structure from the README file, which you can use as a guide to create the project files. Let me know if you'd like help running this code or generating files!
